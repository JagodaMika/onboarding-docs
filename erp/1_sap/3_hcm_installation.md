## Install Microsoft HCM
Please follow the installation guide below to install the Microsoft Hybrid Connection Manager. The purpose of this component is to create a secure channel so the calls from the central integration infrastructure can be made in the local network without the need to open up the ERP instance for public access.

**More information:** [Microsoft HCM Installation guide](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/cts-documentation/Cloud-Connectors/General/Microsoft_HCM/ "Microsoft Hybrid Connection Manager - Installation Guide")

<span style="color:orange">*This step is typically done with a IT administrator to be able to install the HCM client within the network where the ERP resides*</span>
